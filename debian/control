Package: openmpt123
Section: sound
Architecture: any
Depends: ${misc:Depends}, ${shlibs:Depends}
Description: module music library based on OpenMPT -- music player
 libopenmpt is a cross-platform C++ and C library to decode tracked music
 files (modules) into a raw PCM audio stream. It is based on the player code
 of the OpenMPT project, a descendant of the original ModPlug Tracker.
 .
 This package contains the openmpt123 command-line module player.
